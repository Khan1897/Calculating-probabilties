As a student of economics who was into different kind of distributions in Probabilty theory, i discovered that there did not exist a website where people could find all the distributions' formulas and slightly calculate the probabilty. The only way was to use Excel, but not everyone can be evaluated as a good Excel's user. So i decided to create a Dash app, where people can easily and fastly make all the calculations using the formulas for the most essential distributions.
